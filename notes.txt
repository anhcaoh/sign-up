EXERCISE:

Please create a user signup form prototype. Preference is for the code to be done using Reactjs, but you can also feel free to use vanillajs. 
We are currently utilizing reactjs v16.8 for development.

The requirements are:

1. create a form with 3 input fields, 
for the username, password and confirm password respectively

2. persist the state of the input fields entries

3. the password and confirm password input field should valid there entries by comparing both values

4. output to the user when both field match or dont match

5. bonus would be to style the form

Here is some feedback we got on someone’s unsuccessful assessment to give you an idea of what they’re looking for:

“Yes, while this solves the problem, there are some patterns based on the version of reactjs chosen that are a little off. 
He uses an onclick for the form submit instead of the form attribute onSubmit. 
He wouldnt have needed to pass the state setter as arguments 
if he had maintained his methods geared to update the state within scope. 
He's using hooks which he could have better demonstrated with state management. 
He's passing props to the App component when there are no props being used or passed in when the component is mounted. 
This logic is over convoluted - (!!str1 && !!str2) 
&& (str1.length === str2.length) && str1.includes(str2)

 These are some of the bigger issues here.”
